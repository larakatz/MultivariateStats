```{r setup}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, tidy = TRUE)
```

Load libraries
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(vegan)
library(MVA)
library(psych) # describeBy function
library(Hmisc)
library(vegan)
library(StatMatch)

# Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of the Darlingtonia data set using the R function `princomp.` 

Load data:
```{r}
dar <- read.csv("./Darlingtonia.csv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
```

## Data screening

```{r}
describeBy(dar)
```

Look for NA values:
```{r}
describe(dar)
```

Check for multivariate normality:
```{r}
mshapiro.test(t(dar))
```

Mardia test:
```{r}
mvn(dar, mvnTest = "mardia")
```
`height`, `mouth_diam`, `wing1_length`, `wingsprea`, `hoodarea`, and `tubearea` are normal and do not need to be transformed. `tube_diam`, `keel_diam`, `wing2_length`, and `wingarea` are not normally distributed.

## Data transformation

```{r}
dar.t <- transform(dar,
                   height = height,
                   mouth_diam = mouth_diam,
                   tube_diam = log1p(tube_diam),
                   keel_diam = log1p(keel_diam), # still not normal
                   wing1_length = wing1_length,
                   wing2_length = log1p(wing2_length), # still not normal
                   wingsprea = wingsprea,
                   hoodarea = hoodarea,
                   wingarea = log1p(wingarea),
                   tubearea = tubearea)

```

Plot histograms of transformed data to inspect normality:
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(as.data.frame(dar.t), main = colnames(dar.t), xlab = "")
```

## Data standardization

Z-standardization:
```{r}
dar.sc <- as.data.frame(scale(dar.t))
```

Plot histograms:
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
hist(as.data.frame(dar.sc), main = colnames(dar.sc), xlab = "")
```

Check for outliers with `out` function:
```{r}
out <- function(x){
  lier <- x[abs(x)>3]
  return(lier)
}

apply(dar.sc,2,out)
```
There are multiple outliers in this dataset. The first 3 columns do not have outliers but the last 7 columns have one or more outliers.


Check standardized data for multivariate normality:
```{r}
mshapiro.test(t(dar.sc))
```

Mardia test:
```{r}
mvn(dar.sc, mvnTest = "mardia")
```

## Running the PCA

Run the `princomp` function:
```{r}
dar_pca <- princomp(dar.sc, cor = F)
```

Calculate eigenvalues:
```{r}
n <- nrow(dar.sc)
eigenVal<- (dar_pca$sdev*sqrt(n/(n-1)))^2 # n/(n-1) correction because princomp calculates variances with the divisor N
eigenVal
```

Make the PCA table with the eigenvalues instead of the standard deviations:
```{r}
propVar <- eigenVal/sum(eigenVal)
cumVar <- cumsum(propVar)
pca_Table <- t(rbind(eigenVal,propVar,cumVar))
pca_Table
```

## Determining number of axes to keep

Scree plot:
```{r}
plot(dar_pca, type="lines")
```

### Question 1: Based on a scree plot, how many PCA axes should you retain? (5 points)

I would keep the first 4 PCA axes because the scree plot begins to level off after PCA4.

### Question 2: Based on the Latent Root Criterion, how many PCA axes should you retain? (5 points)

I would keep the first 3 PCA axes based on the Latent Root Criterion because the eigenvalues of these three components are greater than 1. PCA4-10 have eigenvalues less than 1.

### Question 3: What percentage of the total variation in pitcher morphology is accounted for by the first two PCA axes? (5 points)

The first two PCA axes have a cumulative variation of 0.697 and therefore account for 69.7% of the total variation in pitcher morphology. 

Factor loadings from `princomp`:
```{r}
loadings(dar_pca)
```

Factor scores:
```{r eval=FALSE}
scores(dar_pca)
```

### Question 4: What 3 variables have the largest loading on PCA 1? (5 points)

`wingarea`, `hoodarea`, and `wing1_length` have the largest loading on PCA1.

### Question 5: What 3 variables have the largest loading on PCA 2? (5 points)

`tube_diam`, `tube_area`, and `keel_diam` have the largest loading on PCA2.

### Question 6:	Make a biplot of the first two PCA axes (attach to your submission) (5 points)

```{r}
plot(dar_pca$loadings,type="n",xlab="PC 1, 47%", ylab="PC 2, 22%",ylim=c(-.8,.8), xlim=c(-.6,.6))

text(dar_pca$loadings, labels=as.character(colnames(dar.sc)), pos=1, cex=1)
abline(h = 0, lty = 3)
abline(v = 0, lty = 3)
```

### Question 7: In one sentence, how would you describe the morphology of pitcher sample 63? (10 points)

```{r}
dar.sc[63,]
```
Pitcher sample 63 has smaller than average measurements for all measured variables, but none of these measurements are outliers (all are < 3 standard deviations from the mean). 


### Question 8: In one sentence, how would you describe the morphology of pitcher sample 75? (10 points)

```{r}
dar.sc[75,]
```
This pitcher plant sample has larger than average measurements for all measured variables, and has an exceptionally large `tubearea` and `hoodarea` (values > 3 standard deviations from the mean).

### Question 9: If you could rename each axis in your biplot to describe the variation they explain, what would you name them? (Donâ€™t just pick the name of the variable that has the highest factor loading)? (10 points)

```{r}
loadings(dar_pca)
```
PC1 seems to be primarily influenced by the overall size of the plant, with `wingarea` and `tubearea` driving positive values along the axis. PC2 seems to be primarily influenced by `tube_diam` and `keel_diam`. I would call PC1 "Area" and PC2 "Diameter."

### Question 10: Now that you have a handle on variation in pitcher morphology for Darlington, describe a research question you could ask using the PCA axes? (10 points)


# Non-metric multi-dimensional (NMDS) analysis of Atlantic and Caribbean island bird communities using the `metaMDS` function in R.

Please answer the following questions based on NMDS of the Atlantic_Caribbean data set. Use the Jaccard index as a distance measure.

Load data:
```{r}
bird <- read.csv("./Atlantic_Caribbean.csv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
head(bird)
```

Fix island names where the accent mark didn't upload: 
```{r}
bird[bird$Island.Name == "Monta\xf1a.Clara",]$Island.Name <- "Montana.Clara"
bird[bird$Island.Name == "San.Ant\xe3o",]$Island.Name <- "San.Antao"
bird$Island.Name
length(unique(bird$Island.Name)) # is each island only surveyed once?
```
Change row names to those of the islands:
```{r}
rownames(bird) <- bird$Island.Name
bird <- bird[,-3]
head(bird)
```

Change categorical variables to factors:
```{r}
bird$Archipelago <- as.factor(bird$Archipelago)
bird$Ocean <- as.factor(bird$Ocean)
```

## Data screening

```{r}
describeBy(bird)
```

Look for NA values:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
describe(bird)
```


## Distance calculation

Separate categorical group data from bird presence-absence data:
```{r}
bird.groups <- bird[,1:2]
bird.pres <- bird[,3:383]
```

```{r}
bird.j <- vegdist(bird.pres, "jaccard")
```

## NMDS

```{r}
nmdsBird <- metaMDS(bird.j, k=2, trace=T)
nmdsBird
```
Shepard diagram:
```{r}
stressplot(nmdsBird)
```


### Question 11: What is the stress value for the NMDS of the island bird communities? (5 points)

### Question 12: Based on this stress value, how well does the ordination represent the original distances? (5 points)

### Question 13: Plot the NMDS using 2 axes and color the islands based on their ocean. Attach the plot to your submission. (5 points)

```{r}
bird.groups$Ocean # what order are the islands in?

n.Atl <- nrow(bird.groups[bird.groups$Ocean == "Atlantic",])
n.Car <- nrow(bird.groups[bird.groups$Ocean == "Caribbean",])
```

Repeat oceans and colors:
```{r}
oceans <- factor(c(rep("Atlantic", n.Atl),rep("Caribbean", n.Car)))
cols <- c("darkblue","cyan4")
colors <- cols[oceans] # only works because the factor names and the data are both in alphabetical order
colors
```

Plot out the points (islands):
```{r}
ordiplot(nmdsBird, type="n")
orditorp(nmdsBird, display="sites", col=colors, air=0.01, cex=0.8)
legend(4,2.8, c("Atlantic","Caribbean"), cex=0.8, 
col=c("darkblue","cyan4"), pch=15:15)
abline(h = 0, lty = 3)
abline(v = 0, lty = 3)
```


### Question 14: What do the results of your NMDS suggest? (10 points)

### Question 15: Plot the NMDS using 2 axes and color the islands based on their archipelago. Attach the plot to your submission. (5 points)

```{r}
levels(bird.groups$Archipelago) # what archipelagos are there?
bird.groups$Archipelago # what order are they in?
```


```{r}
n.Can <- nrow(bird.groups[bird.groups$Archipelago == "Canaries",])
n.CapV <- nrow(bird.groups[bird.groups$Archipelago == "CapeVerdes",])
n.Az <- nrow(bird.groups[bird.groups$Archipelago == "Azores",])
n.Mad <- nrow(bird.groups[bird.groups$Archipelago == "Madeira",])
n.GAnt <- nrow(bird.groups[bird.groups$Archipelago == "GreaterAntilles",])
n.LAnt <- nrow(bird.groups[bird.groups$Archipelago == "LesserAntilles",])
n.Cay <- nrow(bird.groups[bird.groups$Archipelago == "Caymans",])
```

Repeat archipelagos and colors:
```{r}
require(viridis)

#palette <- c(rocket(4, begin = 0.10, end = 0.80), mako(3, begin = 0.30, end = 0.70))
palette <- c(turbo(4, end = 0.35), turbo(3, begin = 0.70))
archs <- c(rep(palette[1], n.Can), 
           rep(palette[2], n.CapV), 
           rep(palette[3], n.Az),
           rep(palette[4], n.Mad),
           rep(palette[5], n.GAnt),
           rep(palette[6], n.LAnt),
           rep(palette[7], n.Cay))
archs
```

Plot out the points (islands):
```{r}
ordiplot(nmdsBird, type="n")
orditorp(nmdsBird, display="sites", col=archs, air=0.1, cex=0.8)
legend(-5.5,.4, c("Canaries","Cape Verdes", "Azores", "Madeira","Greater Antilles", 
                "Lesser Antilles", "Caymans"), cex=0.8,
       col = palette, 
       pch=15:15)

```
